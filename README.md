# Neovim simple yet working config file

This is my Neovim config file you can use it instead of bloated IDEs



## Installation

* Create the init.lua file in your nvim directory
* we will use lua instead of vim script. it's faster

I use packer as my package manager and i recomend you to use it as well

if you use arch there is an AUR package
```bash
yay -S nvim-packer-git
```
other unix distros
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```
after that you are good to go it's just copy and paste
you can change the keymaps and colorschemes to whatever you like i recommend [Gruvbox](https://github.com/ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim)
